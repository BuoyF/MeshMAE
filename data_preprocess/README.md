# Data pre-process


* Maniold
 

To install ManiFold library, you should refer to  [MeshReconstruction](https://github.com/ZhaoHengJiang/MeshReconstruction) 

In this code, 

'root' denotes the data root of the meshes need to be processed.


'output_root_manifold' denotes the root of manifold meshes.


'output_root_simplify' denotes the root of simplified meshes. If you want to process your own data, the meshes in 'output_root_simplify' are what you finally obtained.


* Remesh

To remesh the meshes, you should refer to [SubdivNet](https://github.com/lzhengning/SubdivNet).
